# BiGramApplication
simple bi gram parser
this console app will prompt the user to enter a valid input file name in text format only and a valid output path where to write the results
of the operation. The application reads the content of the text file and parses it and writes to the output file by grouping two words from
the text and reporting how many times that group of two adjacent words took place in the entire input file.

e.g: 
input file
carnivore animals eat meat while herbivore animals eat tough vegetation

output file
carnivore animals: 1
animals eat: 2
eat meat: 1
meat while: 1
while herbivore: 1
hervibore animals: 1
eat tough: 1
tough vegetation: 1
